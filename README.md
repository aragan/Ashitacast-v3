 Aragan Ashitcastv3 xml — The Ultimate Build

version transformers coming

This isn’t just an “update.”
This is a complete, fully-built SCH XML made to be the strongest and most complete AshitaCast v3 setup — a single heavy, professional file that combines core logic + advanced logic in one place.

Aragan_SCH.xml is the “everything” release:

 Core + advanced systems in one build

 Battle-ready logic (Idle / Engaged / Casting / WS)

 Clean, fast Modes / Cycles / Toggles

 Structured for expansion without breaking into chaos

 Built with one mindset: no missing pieces

Why it’s different

Because it follows one rule:
Never leave the user hunting for “the rest of the logic” in other files.
One file. Load it. Play. Upgrade it.

No equal, no substitute

Many XML builds look similar, but collapse under real use: missing logic, weak structure, conflicts, spam loops.
This build is designed as a complete package:

power + completeness + stability + scalability.
